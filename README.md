# Final Fantasy

This is a basic Final Fantasy-themed role-playing video game I made in high school as a fun project to help me learn programming. The code is a terrible mess (concepts like "version control" and "hash tables" were foreign to me at the time) but I'm proud of what I made, and it taught me a lot more about software engineering than any of my early classes did. Plus, the game is a ton of fun!

If you'd like to try it for yourself, download the FinalFantasy.jar file and double-click it on your desktop. I've tested it only on my Windows 10 laptop, so it may or may not work on other systems.

All of the art and music assets are from the Final Fantasy franchise by Square-Enix.
